The primary purpose of `django-rbaca` is to streamline the process of RBAC implementation within your Django projects. By using `django-rbaca`, you gain access to a wide range of benefits, including:

- **Role Definition**: Whether you prefer using the Django admin interface or programmatic methods, `django-rbaca` simplifies the process of defining and managing roles for your application. These roles are instrumental in grouping users based on their responsibilities or access levels.

- **Permission Assignment**: Assigning specific permissions to roles is made straightforward with `django-rbaca`. This allows you to grant or restrict access to various features and functionalities within your application, ensuring that users can only perform actions appropriate to their roles.

- **Access Control Decorators and Mixins**: Enforce access control in your views by leveraging RBAC decorators and mixins. With these decorators and mixins, you can restrict access to specific views, ensuring that only users with the appropriate roles or permissions can access certain parts of your application. This fine-grained access control enhances the security of your application.

- **Template Tags**: `django-rbaca` provides RBAC template tags that enable you to control the visibility of elements within your templates based on user roles and permissions. This is a valuable tool for creating dynamic and personalized user interfaces.

- **Role Based Backend**: The comprehensive Role Based Backend is a core feature of `django-rbaca`. It empowers you to define, assign, and enforce roles, ensuring controlled access to different parts of your application. This feature plays a vital role in enhancing the security and manageability of your Django project.

- **Distributed Access Control**: In addition to local access control, `django-rbaca` provides API endpoints that support distributed access control. This feature allows you to check permissions in distributed systems using JSON Web Tokens and is built on the Django REST Framework.
